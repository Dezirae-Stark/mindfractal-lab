# Roadmap

Development roadmap for MindFractal Lab.

## Current Version: 1.0.0

Core functionality complete:

- 2D fractal dynamics model
- Simulation and visualization
- CLI interface
- Basic extensions

## Planned Features

### Near-term

- [ ] PyPI package release
- [ ] Docker container for webapp
- [ ] Improved test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Medium-term

- [ ] Full 3D visualization (WebGL)
- [ ] Real-time parameter control
- [ ] GPU acceleration (CUDA/OpenCL)
- [ ] Jupyter widget integration

### Long-term

- [ ] Neural network surrogate models
- [ ] Reinforcement learning for parameter optimization
- [ ] VR/AR visualization
- [ ] Multi-user collaborative exploration

## Research Directions

### Theory
