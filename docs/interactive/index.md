-   :material-chart-scatter-plot:{ .lg .middle } **Fractal Explorer**

    ---

    Dive into a world where tiny parameter changes create dramatically different mental landscapes. Watch colors shift between stability and chaos.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Start Exploring](fractal_explorer.md)

-   :material-rotate-3d:{ .lg .middle } **3D Attractor Viewer**

    ---

    See consciousness states unfold in three dimensions. Discover strange attractors — bounded infinities that never quite repeat.

-   :material-star-four-points:{ .lg .middle } **CY Slice Studio**

    ---

    Explore the beautiful Mandelbrot and Julia sets — windows into infinite complexity at every scale.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Open Studio](cy_slice_viewer.md)

-   :material-compass:{ .lg .middle } **Possibility Navigator**

    ---

    Travel through the space of all possible mental configurations. See how stability and chaos intermingle in the landscape of the mind.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Navigate Possibilities](possibility_navigator.md)

-   :material-brain:{ .lg .middle } **Embeddings Explorer**

    ---

    Watch as complex trajectories collapse into revealing 2D maps. Similar dynamics cluster together, revealing hidden structure.

## How It Works

1. **Choose an experience** from the cards above
2. **Wait a moment** while the visualization engine loads
3. **Adjust the sliders** to change parameters
4. **Click Compute** to see the results
5. **Explore** — every combination reveals something new

## What You'll Discover

Each tool lets you explore different aspects of the same underlying mathematics:

| Experience | What You'll See |
|------------|----------------|
| **Fractal Explorer** | How parameter changes affect stability |
| **3D Attractor Viewer** | The shape of consciousness dynamics in space |
| **CY Slice Studio** | Infinite complexity at every zoom level |
| **Possibility Navigator** | The boundary between order and chaos |
| **Embeddings Explorer** | Hidden patterns in trajectory data |

## The Mathematical Heart

Behind every visualization is this deceptively simple equation:

$$
\mathbf{x}_{n+1} = A\mathbf{x}_n + B \tanh(W\mathbf{x}_n) + \mathbf{c}
$$

As you explore, you're directly manipulating the parameters in this equation and watching how they change the resulting dynamics. The math isn't abstract — it's visual, interactive, and waiting to be discovered.

## Two Ways to Explore

Use the mode toggle button in the bottom-right corner:

- **Explorer Mode** — Pure visual exploration, clean interface
- **Researcher Mode** — See the equations and code behind each visualization

Both modes produce the same results. Choose whichever feels right for you.
